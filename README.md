# Blacksmith

### An open-source framework for source code review

**Built on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io)**

The project will initially use [jQuery](http://jquery.com) with a view to move to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) later if Electron turns out to be suitable for the project. Taking it one step at a time!
